# Frequently-asked Questions

## Me want play gaem can I pley gaem I love ms2 where gaem?

This emulator is a work in progress and most parts of the game are incomplete. There is some basic combat and some over world mobs.

## I found a bug or something isn't working right in-game, what should I do?

You can submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlanMorel/MapleServer2/issues) here.

## How do I use the emulator or how does this thing work?

Follow the steps from top to bottom in setup to get a local server hosted and a client that can connect to the server. You can follow the setup and just change the IPs to host a non-local server.

## I'm not great with English or I find text guides confusing, are there any other resources?

There are a couple video guides that have been made, but they will not be entirely up to date. Here is the latest one [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_8rBcu6Sv8).

## Are there commands or how do I spawn items, etc.?

The commands can be found by typing `/commands` in-game, and you can find map/item/mob ids by checking pinned messages in [#help](https://discord.com/channels/783045053501276170/813676820611334194/871885574716424232).

## I'm following the setup but it's not working?

First, confirm that you've downloaded/installed all the necessary components for the server and the correct client, [detailed here](/docs/setup/resources-setup). Then check the [common errors](/docs/fse) to see if they resolve the issue. If you still have problems that are not listed in this faq you can head over to #help and ask for help.
