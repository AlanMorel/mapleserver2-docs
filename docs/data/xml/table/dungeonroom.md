| Attribute | Description | Explanation | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|

| clearType | The type of condition for considering the dungeon complete.<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Can be either trigger or monster.</span> | <span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Monster</span> means the dungeon will be completed once a specific monster is dead. Dungeons with this type of clearType will also have the attribute <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>clearValue</span>, containing the npc id of the specific monster that has to killed.<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Trigger</span> means the dungeon will be completed once the trigger action DungeonClear is sent. | An example of clearType monster is dungeon 23025003 (Normal Madrakan Spire), while 23006003 (Hard Shadow Altar) is an example of clearType trigger.

| cooldownType | Type of run count cooldown.<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Can be either dayOfWeeks or nextDay</span><br/><span style={{color:"#b42514"}}>[This behavior can be overwritten by unionRewardID]</span> | <span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>dayOfWeeks</span> means the dungeon run count will always be reset on an specific day of the week. Dungeons with this type of cooldownType will also always have the attributes <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>cooldownValue</span>, <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>rewardCount</span> and, sometimes, <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>subRewardCount</span>.<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>nextDay</span> means the dungeon run count will always reset in daily reset. Dungeons with this type of cooldownType can have only the attribute <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>rewardCount</span>. | 29001001 (Premium Dungeon) is a dungeon with cooldownType nextDay whose cooldownType isn't overwritten by an unionRewardID, meaning it resets everyday.
| cooldownValue<br/><span style={{color:"#b42514"}}>`<Optional>`</span> | Used only by dungeons with <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>cooldownType dayOfWeeks</span>.<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>1 to 7 number value</span><br/><span style={{color:"#b42514"}}>[This behavior can be overwritten by unionRewardID]</span> | Value represents the day of the week the dungeon will reset on, being 6 (Friday) by default if not specified. | Dungeon 23023003 (Normal Rock n' Rollin' Pink Bean) has a cooldownValue of 6 and resets on Friday.

| rewardCount | Maximum run count<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Number value</span><br/><span style={{color:"#b42514"}}>[This behavior can be overwritten by unionRewardID]</span> | In dungeons of <span style={{color:"#2E6694"}}>cooldownType dayOfWeeks</span>, this is the weekly cap.

| rewardMeso | Base for amount of meso rewarded upon dungeon completion.<br/>Not final value<br/><span style={{color:"#49ADFF"}}>Number value</span> | Keep in mind GMS2 has a x3 meso rate for dungeons, meaning a dungeon with 14000 rewardMeso will reward 42000 upon being completed.<br/>KMS2, in comparison, has a x0.1 rate. | Dungeon 27003001 (Blackshard Nexus) has 12000 rewardMeso and rewards 36000 mesos upon being completed.
